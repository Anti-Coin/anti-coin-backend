# VERIFY.md
Authoritative for: acceptance evidence.

## Done Means Verified
Compilation is not completion. Completion requires verification evidence (`R10`).

## Minimum Requirement
Each non-trivial task must include at least one:
- automated test
- manual verification steps
- runtime evidence (logs/metrics/artifacts)

If not possible, explain why and state residual risk.

## Required Coverage (as applicable)
1) Functional correctness
2) Stability/runtime safety
3) Data integrity and idempotency
4) Failure/degradation behavior
5) Observability

## Reporting Format
- Verified:
- Method:
